# 🐾 creative-code-playground

This is my little space for playing around with HTML & CSS —  
sometimes for fun, sometimes just to jot down ideas 🌿

Nothing serious, just experimenting with UI patterns, animations, and whatever I feel like trying.

It’s mostly for myself, but if anything helps or inspires you, feel free to peek around 🌼
